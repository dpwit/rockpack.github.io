## Introduction

Rockpack is just like Create react App (where it bundles the basic components in one, easy to run package), only better. It still simplifies setting up a React app but it also has a number of additional features already included such as Webpack, server-side rendering, bundling, linting and testing.

### Rockpack modules

One of the good things about Rockpack is the fact that it has a 'modular architecture', meaning it has different modules you can use, so you can only use the Rockpack module you need.

### Modules

- @rockpack/compiler [link](#@rockpack/compiler)
- @rockpack/ussr
- @rockpack/tester
- @rockpack/codestyle
- @rockpack/logger
- @rockpack/localazer

### @rockpack/compiler

This is a Webpack based React bundler that is preconfigured with all the necessary loaders and plugins, using the best practices right out of the box.
